# AgentStack Test Contract

This project has three test tiers. The default tier must be safe for local agents:
it must not create, mutate, inspect, or destroy live cloud resources.

## Default Local Suite

Run from the repo root:

```bash
./scripts/test-local.sh
```

The runner copies tracked and untracked non-ignored files to a temporary worktree
under `/tmp/agent-stack-tests`, then runs all checks there. This keeps `.terraform/`,
provider lock files, generated SSH config, `__pycache__`, and other command side
effects out of the real checkout.

Default-suite commands:

- `terraform init -backend=false`
- `terraform fmt -check -recursive`
- `terraform validate`
- `terraform test`
- `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s skills/agent-stack-setup/tests`
- `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s skills/agent-stack-doctor/tests`
- `bash -n` over runtime shell templates
- before/after `git status --short --untracked-files=all` comparison

Forbidden in the default suite:

- `terraform apply`, `terraform destroy`, `terraform import`, `terraform taint`, or Terraform state mutation
- provider-backed `terraform plan` outside Terraform's mocked test framework
- cloud CLIs or APIs such as `aws`, `doctl`, `hcloud`, `gcloud`, or direct provider API calls
- SSH to deployed instances
- provider migration against real hosts
- inspecting, importing, printing, or summarizing real `~/.codex/auth.json`
- printing secrets, Terraform state, `terraform.tfvars`, `*.tfstate`, `#token=` URLs, or provider tokens

Allowed side effects:

- temporary files under `/tmp/agent-stack-tests`
- Terraform plugin/cache data inside the temporary test worktree
- no changes to repo-tracked or untracked source files after the runner exits

## Mocked Terraform Suite

The default runner executes native Terraform tests from `tests/*.tftest.hcl`.
These tests use `command = plan`, `mock_provider`, mock data files under
`tests/mocks/`, and `expect_failures` for validation cases.

Coverage expectations:

- AWS, DigitalOcean, and Hetzner root provider selection all plan without credentials
- provider child modules plan with mocked providers and stable fake IDs/IPs
- root outputs cover private Tailscale URLs, public-domain URLs, disabled services, and token-import URLs with explicit test tokens
- validation failures cover invalid cloud provider, root SSH user, missing Tailscale key, missing public-domain values, missing external Postgres values, DigitalOcean existing-volume name requirements, invalid model providers, empty default model, and invalid enabled services
- tests set `ssh_public_key`, `repo_ssh_private_key_path`, and `generate_repo_ssh_config = false` so no repo-local key generation or SSH config writes occur

Do not replace mocked `terraform test` coverage with live provider `terraform plan`.
The whole point of this tier is to catch graph, variable, output, and module-wiring
breakage without credentials or cloud APIs.

## Python And Template Suite

Python unit tests cover local helper behavior and static contracts that Terraform
cannot inspect well:

- `render_tfvars.py` output, placeholder rejection, merge behavior, and defaults from `variables.tf`
- Codex auth import behavior against temp fixtures only
- DigitalOcean volume selection
- provider migration helper help text and safety invariants
- cloud-init loader scope, runtime template contents, private staging permissions, layout migration, and Terraform runtime provisioning contracts
- module input parity across AWS, DigitalOcean, and Hetzner shared runtime inputs
- doctor scripts and legacy compatibility checks

Keep these tests local-only. They may create temporary files, but they must not
read real Codex auth, Terraform state, provider tokens, or cloud resources.

## Optional Live Smoke Suite

Live smoke testing is intentionally not implemented in the default runner. If it
is added later, gate it behind an explicit opt-in such as:

```bash
AGENT_STACK_LIVE_TESTS=1 ./scripts/test-live.sh
```

Live tests must:

- require explicit credentials and an explicit provider
- create namespaced temporary resources only
- never reuse existing volumes
- verify SSH, cloud-init loader readiness, `/opt/agent-stack`, Docker Compose health, and one UI endpoint
- clean up resources and report any cleanup failure loudly
- document expected cloud cost and duration before running

## Evidence Report

Every default local run prints:

```markdown
## Test Evidence

Workspace dirty before run:
Workspace dirty after run:
Cloud-impacting commands run: none

| Phase | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
```

Only mark a phase `pass` when the evidence is machine-checkable from commands
or local tests. Missing cloud credentials are irrelevant to the default suite
and must not block it.
